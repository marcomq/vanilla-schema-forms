  title: Optimize Customization for mq-bridge schema
  description: >-
    Optimize schema to improve UX: 
    1. Endpoint should be the first parameter in the form. First input, then output.
    2. Split input and output into visibly separate sections. 
    3. Compact input format. Don't show label above input. Render with label on left, input next and description on right in one line.
    4. Instead of being able to add middlewares, try to have checkboxes for middlewares, as multiple middleware with same type don't make sense. Just one middleware of each type is possible.
    5. Options are usually irrelevant. Hide options and make them configurable via additional button or extra tab.
